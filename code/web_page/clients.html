			<h2>Client Profile</h2>
			<p>The CEO started the company with two partners who oversee the investment part, but he decided to hire mainly young recently graduated students from the university. Since the company is not really big, the company's customers are mainly not millionaires, but rather millennial workers who want to efficiently use their savings to increase their wealth in the long run or improve their retirement plan.</p>

			<p>The CEO's bet was that these customers prefer to deal with agents of a similar age who interact in an informal way and rely extensively on ICT for communications. The company differentiates itself from classical wealth management due to the different communication style and targeting, but also from robot-advisors because it is able to deliver the human touch that many customers appreciate. Despite the difficulties of launching a new company of this type, it seems that the CEO is winning his bet!</p>

			<h3>Ideal Customers</h3>
			<p>The ideal customers for Prospera are individuals or families with a gross annual remuneration between 100k and 70k. However, they have some selected customers with higher income and some with lower.</p>

			<p>The first group consists of customers who could switch to a bigger competitor, but they are retained with the promising financial results and the distinguishing customer relationship. The latter group is selected by the company because they could advance in their careers and increase their savings, or they become customers through word of mouth. At this stage of the company, almost no customer who is willing to invest a relevant or periodic amount gets rejected.</p>

			<h3>Targeted Customer Segments</h3>
			<p>The efforts of the business development and sales team are mainly towards the following types of customers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Youth Professionals:</strong> Highly educated young workers with jobs that provide a relevant salary, such as consultants, engineers, developers, doctors, and dentists. They may be looking to build wealth, save for major life milestones, or navigate complex financial decisions.</li>
				<li><strong>Wealth Accumulators:</strong> Customers who have been working for at least 8 years and are in the wealth accumulation phase of their lives, focusing on building assets, saving for future goals such as homeownership, starting a family, or retirement planning.</li>
				<li><strong>Rising Stars:</strong> Customers who are not able to currently invest a relevant amount, but are likely to increase their savings in the next few years. These customers are financially conscious and eager to gain knowledge and insights into managing their money effectively.</li>
				<li><strong>Entrepreneurial Mindset:</strong> Prospera's customers include individuals with side businesses, startup ventures, or aspirations for entrepreneurship. These customers require specialized guidance on managing personal finances to face risks associated with their activities.</li>
				<li><strong>Values-Driven Investors:</strong> Segment of Prospera's customers who seek opportunities to invest in companies or funds that prioritize environmental sustainability, social impact, or ethical practices.</li>
